Smart Itinerary Planner Using Machine Learning
This project is a machine learning-based travel itinerary planner that recommends flights, hotels, and local attractions based on user inputs like source, destination, and budget. It uses classification and regression models trained on travel-related data to suggest optimized travel plans.

üöÄ Running the Project
1. Preprocess the data
bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/preprocess_data.py
Cleans and prepares the datasets.

2. Train Hotel Classifier (KNN)
bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/train_hotel_classifier.py
Trains a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier to classify hotels based on amenities and price.

3. Train Budget Prediction Model
bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/train_budget_model.py
Trains a regression model to estimate total budget based on user and city parameters.

4. Test Models (Optional)
bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/test_models.py
Evaluates accuracy and performance of the models on test datasets.

5. Run the Itinerary Planner
bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Launches the interactive planner where user can input:

Source and destination

Number of days

Preferred type of hotel

Budget

And get recommendations for:

Best-matching flights

Suitable hotels

Local attractions

Estimated trip cost

üß† Models Used
KNN for Hotel Classification

Linear Regression / Random Forest for Budget Estimation

Rule-based filtering for Flights and Attractions

üìà Future Enhancements
Integration with real-time flight/hotel APIs (Skyscanner, Amadeus)

Personalized recommendations using user history

Map-based UI

Mobile version with GPS-aware recommendations
